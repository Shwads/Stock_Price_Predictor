# Stock_Price_Predictor

A stock price predictor I made for my thesis project in my Bachelors. The general thrust of my research was to train a number of neural nets to make simple predictions on stock data and then to test these models using synthetic test cases to reverse engineer these models and construct simple rule bases to explain their behaviour to stakeholders without domain specific knowledge.
